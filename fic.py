        'Content': '''Atsumu scrolls around on YouTube, feeling like he's spiralling a little into the odd corners of it when some recommended videos are "I'm a Plague Doctor and You've Been Diagnosed with the Black Plague ASMR" or videos of people eating truly remarkable amounts of food. No judgement (maybe a little bit, he's no angel), but mukbangs make him hungry and whispering roleplay makes his ears itch. A video called "Study With Me: Pomodoro Technique #1" appears and he clicks on it.

                        The channel's name is endomiphins, and the thumbnail features a view of a man from the neck downward at his desk, notebook and laptop open.

                        Atsumu presses play.

                        Sakusa is a barista by day, ASMR and study YouTuber by night, and Atsumu falls a little in love with both.''',

        'Content': '''Sakusa is used to attention. As a full-time student and a part-time streamer, his videos of gameplay garner thousands of views on a daily basis.

                    Still, nothing can prepare him for what it's like to have the attention of Miya Atsumu. Atsumu is many things: chatty, endearing, earnest. But he's more observant than most give him credit for.

                    And he might be the only person who reminds Sakusa to take care of himself.''',
